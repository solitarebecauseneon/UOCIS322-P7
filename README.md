This project expanded upon project 6. In this stage, two different types of authentication
were added: a token-based authentication on the server-side, and a login-based authentication
on the client side. This project now contains a database that contains both brevet information
and user data, two forms of authentication, 2 different web interfaces along with an
API as well as several HTML files. Thank you for helping us through this Ali, I learned
a lot from you! Have a great summer.
